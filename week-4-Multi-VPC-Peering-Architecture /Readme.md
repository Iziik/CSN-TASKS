##Multi-VPC Peering Architecture

In this task, you will create two seperate VPCs in your AWS environment to simulate a multi-vpc architecture

-Configure **VPC-A** with the CIDR block **10.10.0.0/16** and **VPC-B** with **10.20.0.0/16**
-In each VPC, create one public subnet and one private subnet 
-Establish a **VPC peering connection** between the two VPCs.
-Update the **route tables** in each VPC to allow traffic to flow between them via the peering connection.
